== Description ==
   Simply put, Content Icons is a tool that an author can use to assign "icons" or "images" to individual posts...
   Similar in idea to having Topic Icons. However, biggest difference being, topic icons only display icons that are 
   related or associated with the category (Hence Topic Icon). Content Icons allows author to assign icons such that 
   a reader can readily make an association with the post.


== Installation ==
   1. Download and Extract the zip file.
   2. Upload the content-icons folder in the plugins directory (ROOT/wp-content/plugins/)
   3. Login as Admin and go to the Plugins Management Area
   4. This Plugin ("Content-Icons") should be visible   > Activate it
++ 5. Upload your desired icons/images inside the upload directory (ROOT/wp-content/uploads/cicons/)
--    5.a. This directory should be created for you when you activated this Plugin
   6. That's it! now, whenever you go to add new post or edit existing ones, you should
      see a section labeled "Content Icons" on right side of the screen.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
   Please refer to the [Project's Home Page](http://www.codingrush.com/project-release/content-icons-plugin-release)


== Where Can I get the Icons From? ==
   I got all my icons from [Icon Archive](http://www.iconarchive.com/) That's just one place... I am sure there are plenty more
   sites where you can get free icons/images for use with this plugin. (remember, the file type has to be either
   jpg, jpeg, gif, or png)
